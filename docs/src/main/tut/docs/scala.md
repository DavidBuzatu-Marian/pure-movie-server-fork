# Scala

Scala is quite a large language, with a lot of features â€” good and bad. We use quite a precise subset of the language features in implementing the pure movie server, generally the ones used by the pure functional programming Scala community at large.

Therefore, you have to insist on some features more than others, and this page hopes to achieve the correct balance between providing materials needed to understand everything we do, while still portraying the Scala language in its full richness as much as possible.

### The very basics of Scala

One of the best resources to start learning is "Essential Scala" by Noel Walsh and Dave Gurnell from underscore.io. It's [available for free](https://underscore.io/training/courses/essential-scala/) as a pdf. It covers basic language constructs, syntax, and most importantly it insists on all the right things needed to understand pure functional programming in the long run.

Honestly there's nothing to exclude from the book. This section will be expanded to point to specific concepts used in pure movie server.
