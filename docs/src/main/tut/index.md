# Pure Movie Server

Head over to the [Getting Started](docs/) section of the documentation and continue from there.

## purpose

This is an example larger than the average "hello world" program. It's purpuse is to showcase how to write purely functional web servers in Scala using the [typelevel](https://typelevel.org/) ecosystem. The implementation features some of the same patters we have successfully used in production environments here at [BusyMachines](https://www.busymachines.com/). It is continuously evolving and updated, and any suggestions are welcome.

This microsite does not assume any Scala knowledge, including basic things like the most fundamental tooling, so help will be provided all along the way. But please be patient, it takes time to write down all that stuff.

## ecosystem

A pure functional web server implemented in Scala using the typelevel stack:
* cats
* cats-effect
* monix
* fs2
* doobie
* http4s
* circe
